# Kubernetes Components


## CONTROL PLANE COMPONENTS

These components make global decisions about the cluster (like scheduling), and detect and respond to cluster events (like starting a new pod when a deployment’s replicas field is unsatisfied).

---
1. kube-apiserver
* 📌 Role: The front-end (entry point) for the Kubernetes control plane.
* 📄 Function:
	* Exposes the Kubernetes API (REST interface).
	* Accepts commands from kubectl, other control plane components, or clients.
	* Validates and processes REST requests, updates etcd, and communicates with other components.

✅ Highly available — you can run multiple kube-apiserver instances.

---

2. etcd
* 📌 Role: The key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster data.
* 📄 Function:
	* Stores the state of the entire cluster: nodes, pods, configs, secrets, etc.
	* Highly consistent and reliable.
	* It’s the single source of truth for Kubernetes.

💡 Think of etcd as the “database” of Kubernetes.

---

3. kube-scheduler
* 📌 Role: Schedules pods onto nodes.
* 📄 Function:
	* Watches for unscheduled pods.
	* Selects a node based on resource availability, taints, affinity rules, etc.
	* Writes its decision (node assignment) back to the API server.

✅ Only assigns pods to nodes, doesn’t actually start them.

---

4. kube-controller-manager
* 📌 Role: Runs controller processes.
* 📄 Function:
	* A controller is a loop that watches the desired state in the cluster and ensures the actual state matches.
	* Manages:
	* Node controller
	* Replication controller
	* Deployment controller
	* Namespace controller
	* Service account controller

💬 All these controllers are bundled into a single binary (kube-controller-manager), running as one process.

---

5. cloud-controller-manager (optional, for cloud-based clusters)
* 📌 Role: Manages cloud-specific control logic.
* 📄 Function:
	* Interacts with cloud provider APIs.
	* Manages:
	* Node lifecycle in the cloud (e.g., adding/removing VMs)
	* Load balancers
	* Storage volumes

☁️ Required only when running Kubernetes on a cloud like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

---

## NODE (WORKER) COMPONENTS

These run on every node (physical or virtual machine) in the cluster and are responsible for managing containers.

---

6. kubelet
* 📌 Role: The agent that runs on each node.
* 📄 Function:
	* Receives instructions from the API server.
	* Ensures containers in pods are running and healthy.
	* Watches the PodSpecs assigned to its node and reports back status.

💬 It does not create containers directly — it talks to container runtimes (like containerd or Docker).

---

7. kube-proxy
* 📌 Role: Manages networking for pods and services.
* 📄 Function:
	* Maintains network rules on each node.
	* Implements service discovery and load balancing.
	* Forwards traffic to the correct pod IPs.

🧠 Uses iptables, ipvs, or eBPF under the hood to route traffic.

---

8. Container Runtime
* 📌 Role: Runs containers on each node.
* 📄 Function:
	* Starts, stops, and manages containers.
	* Interfaces with the kubelet.

🔧 Examples:
* containerd ✅ (default in many distributions)
* CRI-O
* Docker (deprecated for production use with Kubernetes ≥ 1.24)

---

## OTHER IMPORTANT INTERNAL COMPONENTS


---
9. CoreDNS
* 📌 Role: Internal DNS service for the cluster.
* 📄 Function:
	* Resolves internal service names (e.g., my-service.default.svc.cluster.local) into IPs.
	* Allows service discovery.



10. Add-ons (Optional but Common)
* Add functionality like monitoring, logging, dashboard, etc.
* Metrics-server – collects resource usage metrics.
* Kubernetes Dashboard – web UI.
* Flannel / Calico / Cilium – for container networking (CNI plugins).
* Ingress Controller – like NGINX Ingress, to manage external access.


# kubectl

## Install kubectl

[Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) 

kubectl is the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage and monitor applications, inspect cluster resources, and more. Some common commands include listing resources, describing resources, and creating and deleting resources. 

## Commonly used kubectl commands: 
### kubectl get:

Retrieves and displays information about one or more resources. 

```bash
kubectl get pods: Lists all pods. 
kubectl get nodes: Lists all nodes. 
kubectl get services: Lists all services. 
kubectl get deployments: Lists all deployments. 
kubectl get namespaces: Lists all namespaces. 
kubectl get all --all-namespaces: Lists all resources across all namespaces. 
```

### kubectl describe:
Displays detailed information about a specific resource. 
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod_name>: Describes a specific pod. 
kubectl describe node <node_name>: Describes a specific node. 
kubectl describe service <service_name>: Describes a specific service. 
```

### kubectl create:
Creates a new resource. 

```bah
kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_name>: Creates a new deployment. 
kubectl create namespace <namespace_name>: Creates a new namespace. 
```

### kubectl apply:
Applies changes to resources based on a YAML or JSON file, or a directory containing such files. 
```bash
kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml: Applies changes from the specified file. 
kubectl apply -k <directory_name>: Applies changes from the specified directory, using Kustomize if present. 
```

### kubectl delete:
Deletes resources. 
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod_name>: Deletes a pod. 
kubectl delete service <service_name>: Deletes a service. 
kubectl delete deployment <deployment_name>: Deletes a deployment. 
kubectl delete namespace <namespace_name>: Deletes a namespace. 
```

### kubectl logs:
Retrieves logs from a pod. 
```bash
kubectl logs <pod_name>: Retrieves logs for a pod. 
kubectl logs -f <pod_name>: Streams logs in real-time. 
kubectl logs --since=1h <pod_name>: Retrieves logs from the last hour. 
```

### kubectl exec:
Executes a command inside a container. 
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- bash: Opens an interactive bash shell inside the pod. 
```

### kubectl port-forward:
Forwards a local port to a port on a pod or service. 
```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/<pod_name> <local_port>:<container_port>: Forwards a local port to a container port. 
```

### kubectl scale:
Scales the number of replicas in a deployment. 
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/<deployment_name> --replicas=<replica_count>: Scales the deployment. 
```

### kubectl rollout:
Used for managing deployments and their rollouts. 
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment_name>: Checks the status of a deployment's rollout. 
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name>: Shows the history of rollouts for a deployment. 
kubectl rollout restart deployment/<deployment_name>: Restarts a deployment. 
```

### kubectl version:
Shows the client and server versions of Kubernetes. 

### kubectl cluster-info:
Shows information about the Kubernetes cluster.

### kubectl config:
Manages Kubernetes configuration files. 
```bash
kubectl config get-contexts: Lists available contexts in your kubeconfig. 
kubectl config use-context <context_name>: Sets the current context. 
```
